    <img style="color:white;" src ="images/Christmas.JPG" alt="Photo 1" data-message="I think this was christmas of 2017, I had just finished basic training and had been released to my family for the holiday. I was never one for public events, but I knew how hard my parents worked to bring us to this family event. Due to my severe anxiety disorder (undiagnosed at the time) I tended to be a downer during these types of excersions. However, on this day I was strong enough to overcome my anxiety and allow myself to live in the moment and enjoy time that I would spend with them. It would be almost a year until I would see them next." >
    <img src="images/Daughter.JPG".jpg alt="Photo 2" data-message="This is my Nana, I am extremely thankful my daughter got to meet her before she passed away. I miss her advice and I always wonder what she would say if I filled her in on the past few years.">
    <img src="images/hurricane.JPG" alt="Photo 3" data-message="In October of 2017 I was startled awake my door being banged on. I answered the door to one of the guys in my unit saying we needed to run to secure the F-22's on the flight-line. Everything was still not a single bit of wind in the air, and within the next three hours we escorted the pilots to the full row of F-22's, and launched them one by one. Uncertain our future,  we were tasked with evacuating 500 miles outside of Panama City, Florida. Six hours later I arrived to a bar in New Orleans and watched as the category five hurricane decimated every inch of everything we owned. ">
    <img src="images/family.png" alt="Photo 4" data-message="This is my family! I have two sons named Elijah and Oliver. while they may not be biologically mine I put everything into raising them to be respectful and strong young men. My daughter is named Everly, she is 4 years old and has a short fuse. My wife and I met in high School in AP Government, that was almost 8 years ago now and it feels as if I am falling in love with her for the first time everyday.">
    <img src="images/Wife.JPG" alt="Photo 5" data-message="I had always wanted to show the kids and my wife some of my old stomping grounds when I was a teen. I spent a majority of my time in between California and Arizona but my happiest moments were always on the beaches in carlsbad. This day we spent picking some of the most beautiful organic strawberries. they made for some amazing ice-cream toppings.">
    <img src="images/canada.jpg" alt="Photo 6" data-message="In the summer of 2016, I drove across the United States to my extended families home state of Michigan. I had been to Michigan before but they lived in the upper pennisual, it was the most beautiful place I had ever seen. This was the US/ Canadian border, it is a system of locks that even out the level of the lake to ensure the cargo ships leave and return to port safely">
